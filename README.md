<h1 align="center">SkipFlow â€“ Code Distribution Platform</h1>

The following repository contains the source code of the `SkipFlow` platform. It is
an oversimplified abstraction of a code distribution platform, like `GitHub`, written
in `Java`. The source code was part of a workshop held by the `SKIP` student organization,
delivering a hands-on experience with `Git` (Version Control System) and `GitHub` (Code
Hosting Platform).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the workshop instructions provided during the event to complete exercises.
  - The required missing implementations are marked with `TODO` comments.
3. Practice `Git` commands for version control.
4. Work **collaboratively** with fellow students on coding tasks.
